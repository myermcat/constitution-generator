## üìÑ How to Save as PDF (Most Important!)

**This is the #1 feature you'll use:**

2. **Edit** your constitution content as needed
3. **Click "Export PDF"** button
4. **Print dialog opens** - Look for the **"Destination"** dropdown
5. **Change destination** from your printer to **"Save as PDF"**
6. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: In the print dialog, **uncheck "Headers and footers"** to remove the file path
